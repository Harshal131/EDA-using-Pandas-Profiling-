# EDA-using-Pandas-Profiling-

A small repo to understand and implement pandas profiling

## Pandas Profiling.

Creates an interactive HTML report from a pandas DataFrame. As we know Exploration Data Analysis is one of the most important steps in the OSEMN freamework. This library creates a very good visual summary of the columns as well as the corelations between them.

## Pros:

*	Generates a very good profile report from the DataFrame very quickly.
*	Very easy to understand and implement.
*	To get a quick and brief understading of your data or to share the inital Exploration Data Aanlysis(EDA).

## Cons:

*	Does not work on large datasets.

## To overcome this disadvantage:

*  Use a small randomly sampled data instead of using the whole dataset.
